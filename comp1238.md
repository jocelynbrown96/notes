## Week 1: Historical Introduction to Text and Writing
- Anything that has happened before writing is from archaeology- we find objects (such as bones) and try to deduce what has happened.
- 30,000 years ago. Cave located in France- Rhinos Chauvet Cave. Possibly displaying seasons and migration patterns of animals in the area.
- 20,000 years ago. Ishango Bone with markings displaying tally marks used for correspondence counting. Sophisticated counting, not yet writing.
- 10,000 years ago. Turkey- Gobekli Tepe site, stone carvings and sophisticated architecture. Was a surprise when discovered in 1963, but serious excavation only started in 1995. Only about 10% of the site is excavated.
- First writing we know of today- Sumerian clay tablets, 5000 years ago from Mesopotamia. Contains beer and grain delivery records from around 3000BCE.
- Mesopotamia comes from the Ancient Greek word ----:  [land] between rivers. The rivers are the Euphrates and the Tigris (the Rivers of Babylon) flowing through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. This is also known as the “Fertile Crescent”. It is a region in the Middle East. Sumer Akkad Assyria Babylon and later Persian Empire developed there. 
- Cuneiform, in Latin means wedge-shaped. Babylonian numbers were drawn in this way. Mostly writing on clay as it’s the most abundant material. Take a piece of clay and a stylus with sharp edges that they’d press into the clay.
- A tablet containing numbers in cuneiform script- Plimpton 322 tablet, written around 1800BC. The rightmost column contains numbers 1, 2, 3... 14 is partially visible, 15 missing with the missing bottom right corner. 
- Egyptian Numerals- special symbols for 1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s. They enjoyed illustration. 1 million- ‘the amazed dude’.
- Roman Numerals 1 = I, 2= II, 3 = III, 4 = IV, 5 = V, 6 = VI, 10 = X, 50 = L, 100 = C, 500 = D, 1000 = M XLII=42 
- Evolution of Cuneiform: each glyph usually represents a syllable. Original symbols usually derived from a word that started with that sound but then evolved. Modern Japanese Hiragana/Katakana letters work the same way.
- Epic of Gilgamesh- A work of literature. 4000 years ago written down as an epic around 2000BC, collection of folk stories. Talks about pride and hubris, friendship and death. Quest for immortality that fails. Ends with Gilgamesh writing down his story as the closest approximation of immortality a mortal human can have. Same story we find in the Bible and Greek mythology.
- Tablet in Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian. Located on southern slope of mountain adjacent to the Van Fortress in modern day Turkey. King Xerxes the Great wrote this (486-465 BC). Founding father of Persian Empire. Text talks about how great he is.
- Chinese and Mesoamerican systems have probably evolved independently. Indian Brahmi script might have been influenced by the Phoenician alphabet, this is debated. Some “recently” developed scripts: Korean Hangul used from 15th century CE. Inuktitut syllabics- used in Canada (from 1870s) 
- Modern alphabets in Europe and Middle East descend from the Egyptian writing system that evolved around the same time and was influenced by the Sumerian system. 
- Printing is almost as old as writing. Cylinder that was used as a kind of personal stamp. Belonged to a queen or facility in Mesopotamia. It comes from more than 4000 years ago. Cylinder seal of First Dynasty of Ur Queen Puabi, found in her tomb dated circa 2600 BC. 
- Woodblock printing- painting and stamping on paper. One of the best-known woodblock prints is the Great Wave off Kanagawa, Japan 1831. 
- Movable Type- small blocks- one per character, made of wood or ceramic rearranged each time to print a new text. Invention often attributed to Bi Sheng from China 972-1051 AD 
- Johannes Gutenberg worked as goldsmith and jeweler. Improved and commercialized the printing process (around 1450AD). He didn't invent printing but he improved and streamlined the process. He actually commercialized it through business. 
- The Press: Letters part of metal pieces. Fairly simple tools to typeset the messages you would like to print. Steel punch, punch against a copper matrix. Use a device with the matrix to pour a metal that melts easily. A combination of lead, antimony and tin. Specific proportions and the combination of the metals used for alloy were very important. 
- Much of writing at the time was made on animal skin as paper was too expensive. 
- The Gutenberg Bible at the New York Public Library- about 180 copies were made, about 49 survived until today (not all complete, some have pages missing). This was considered a luxury product. 
- By 1500, Renaissance Venice was Europe’s printing capital with 150 presses at work. The printing press contributed significantly to the Protestant Reformation which split the Catholic Church. 
- Terminology Inherited From 500 Years of Book Printing: Typeface- the literal face of the type piece, now used interchangeably with “font”. Font- a set of type pieces of particular size and weight. Font weight- bold, regular, light... Serif and sans-serif fonts. Typesetting- now describes the process of preparing printable files (PDFs). Uppercase and Lowercase: These terms come from the physical arrangement of type in the case drawers used by typesetters. Uppercase letters were store in the upper drawer, and lowercase letters in the lower drawer. 
- By 1700s we had a super sophisticated printing industry.
- Typewriters: Monospace- A monospaced (fixed-width) font, is a font whose characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space. In books we use proportional fonts. Typewriters used monospace fonts. Most text editors for coding use monospace fonts for ease of reading.
- Carriage Returns and New Lines: Paper moves sideways as we type. The piece that holds the paper is called the carriage. And every time you type it moves sideways. When you get to the end of the line, a bell  
sound appears you take the handle and you move the carriage back to the beginning of the paper “return the carriage to the beginning of the line”. This is why the Enter key is sometimes called the Return key and why it got the weird down and left arrow. 

## Week 2: Representing Text and Numbers in Computers
- Computer Memory and Storage- Punch card. If there’s a hole, one state of the card. If there’s no hole- different state on that card. Was one of the most basic ways of conveying information. 
- The “bit”- when we are limited to only two states. The tiniest piece of information in computing and communication. Can hold one of two possible values (0/1, true/false, on/off). “bit” is short for “Binary Digit”. 
- Bytes- group of bits. 1 bit is of limited use- so we group bits into “bytes”. Groups of 6, 8 and 9 bits were common in early days. Now everyone uses bytes consisting of 8 bits. Sometimes the term “word” is used for a group of several bytes (8 bytes = 64 bits is common in modern systems).
- Samuel Morse-  developed the Telegraph system (morse code) together with a physicist Joseph Henry and mechanical engineer Alfred Vail around 1837. Morse code- short sequence for frequent letters, long sequence for not so frequent letters.
- Magnetic Core Memory- any of a class of computer memory devices consisting of a large array of tiny toruses of a hard magnetic material that can be magnetized in either of two directions. The two directions can represent either of the values, 0 or 1, in a binary bit. Magnetic-core memory entered widespread use in the 1950s and was supplanted by semiconductor memory chips in the 1970s. 
- Volatile and Nonvolatile Memory- Volatile= gets erased when electricity is gone. Volatile memory is used as short-term working memory, its usually much faster but much more expensive. Nonvolatile memory is used for long term storage= Hard drive, SD card, flash drive, CD/DVD discs, tape, punch cards, clay tablets.... 
- RAM vs Storage- Long term memory- called storage or disk. Usually slower and optimized to read or write large chunks of data at a time. Volatile working memory- usually called RAM (random access memory, its fast for reading from any location)
- Units of measurement- Kilo, Mega, Giga prefixes like usual. 1 Megabyte = 8 MegaBits. But kilo = 1000 or 1024 2 to the power of 10. Both are used, difference may be important in some cases.
- Anything to the power of 0 is 1.
- Positional numeral systems. Common options for the “base”/”radix”. Positional because the meaning of a digit depends on position- eg hundreds vs thousands. The base of the system is how many digits it uses, also called “radix”.
- 2- Binary- 0,2. 8- Octal- 0 to 7, 10- Decimal- 0 to 9. 16- Hexadecimal- 0 to 9 and A-F 
- For some representations we have only one meaning, no ambiguity: the word “five”, the digit 5. All the digits and spoken numbers up to 9 have only one meaning. But when we say “ten” do we mean” the number of fingers on two hands OR the digits 1 and 0 written together as 10? 
- Rules to avoid confusion- Whenever you use world like “ten” or “twelve”: always use them to represent the number they mean in everyday language. Not the string of digits “10” and “25”. When you want to say a binary number 10- spell out the digits “binary one zero” as if you are talking over a radio.
- Lower subscript in writing specifies the radix/base.
- Computer sees the memory as one long sequence of bytes. It can look up the value in each one of the bytes.
- Signed numbers (positive and negative)- we could use the first bit for sign, but the most commonly used system is where the first bit stands for negative 2 to the power of N. 
- Fixed point notation- for prices if we assume we can only use whole cents (price can be 3.45 but not 3.455). Write all the digits, but remember that the dot separates the last two of them. This is equivalent to storing the prices in cents in this case. 
- Floating point notation- to write the number 4.7988 1. Write out the digits: 47988 2. Write where the decimal point is: 4 positions from the end 3. Store both numbers (4 and 47988) and use them to represent a single fractional number 4.7988 = 47988 x 10 to the power of –4.
- How large can the numbers be? Some early computers could only address 64KB of memory because the address was stored as a two-byte integer so they could only count to 65, 535. Its common to represent time using a 4-byte integer that keeps the number of seconds since the start of January 1st, 1970. Its called “Unix Time”. In 2038, this representation will overflow in what is known as the “year 2038 problem”. 
- ASCII encoding- ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A table of characters (and “control codes”) to standardize communication. Control codes don’t print a character but send some other command like line-feed or ring bell. Ranges from 0-127 characters. Extended ASCII was created later on, ranging from 128-255. Consists of accented letters, Greek letters, mathematical symbols and such. 
- Text Mode- Computer rooms in 1960s had no screens. Operator types a command to the system and the system responds by typing the response back on a piece of paper. 
- Then screens appeared, but before we could control each pixel on the screen we used “Text Mode”. First screens were direct replacement for printers. “Text Mode” divides the screen into a grid, usually 80 columns by 25 lines, putting a character in each cell. Low-level hardware would light up the right pixels to display each character. 
- Htop utility on Linux- often used on modern computers (terminal).
- “Code pages” for other languages- people started using the 128-255 range for a variety of characters from other languages Latin1- the most common (often default) code page and Windows  Code Pages CP- 125x. It was a mess, avoid anything other than Latin1 if possible. Use Unicode UTF-8 for other languages.
- Files are sequences of bytes- We decide what the bytes mean and how to interpret them. Text files are files where each byte is interpreted as a character (or special symbol line new-line).
- Each byte can be shown as a character for any file, not only text files. Any file can be displayed as a text file, even if it looks ugly (binary file). 

## Week 3- Structure of Text
- Text consists of: Lines (newline), Spaces- whitespace and indentation, Paragraphs.
- Alphanumeric characters-  letters and digits like a, b c and 0 to 9.
- Non-alphanumeric characters are everything else- Example: +;- sometimes shortened as non-alpha.
- General punctuation: , 0x2C comma . 0x2E full stop, period, decimal point : 0x3A colon ; 0x3B semicolon ? 0x3F question mark ! 0x21 exclamation point, bang - 0x2D hyphen, minus sign “ 0x22 double quote mark ‘ 0x27 right (closing) quotation mark, apostrophe ‘ 0x60 left (opening) single qoutation mark, backtick 
- Brackets: 0x28 left parenthesis 0x29 right parentheses 0x5B left (square) bracket 0x5D right (square) bracket 0x7B left (opening) brace 0x7D right (closing) brace  0x3C left (opening) angle bracket, less-than sign 0x3E right (closing) angle bracket, greater-than-sign 
- Mathematical Symbols: + 0x2B plus sign * 0x2A asterisk, multiplication sign / 0x2F slash, division sign = 0x3D equal sign % 0x25 percent sign 
- Miscellaneous: # 0x23 number, hash or pound sign $ 0x25 dollar sign & 0x26 ampersand, and sign @ 0x40 commercial at-sign \ 0x5C backslash ^ 0x5E caret, hat _ 0x5F underscore | 0x7C vertical bar, pipe ~ 0x7E tilde 
- Symbols with Multiple Meanings and Names: Dash as in “8-bit number” or minus as in 8 – 3 = 5 Angled bracket like in <br> or less-than symbol as in 3 < 5 
- Markup Before Computers: In the publishing industry, people needed to transfer text between each other with additional information. Reporter to editor.
- Proofreading Markup: Used when marking things like essays in red pen, used commonly in research writing.
- Computer Markup Language: Provide instructions on how to a. display text b. interpret text.
- MarkDown: Designed to be very straight forward and simple. Plain text view- written in the MarkDown language. Rendered view- makes the plain text view visually pleasing to the user.
- Popular MarkDown Languages: HTML- HyperText Markup Language XML- eXtensible ML YAML- Yet Another Markup Language or YAML Ain’t Markup Language MarkDown Wikitext/ Wiki Markup- used to edit Wikipedia 
- HTML and the World Wide Web were proposed by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN.
- HTML and the Browsers: HTML is rendered by the browser. The browsers are some of the most complex projects on the planet. Browsers adhere to many standards maintained and developed by the W3C and some other organizations. Thanks to strict standards all browsers can (mostly) display all web pages. Even the very first page can still be displayed.
- Structured Data: A spreadsheet table feels more structured than a regular text document. 
- JSON and XML: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. JSON is newer and taking over, but XML is still used a lot. Both are text-based formats used to serialize structured data, they are intended to be read by computer software, but still be human-readable.
- Special Characters and "Escaping": MarkDown assigns special meaning to characters like # - they are used to render titles. They are called special or reserved characters. "Escaping" using the backslash method is used in most languages. In MarkDown \ # means print a literal #
- Escaping in HTML: In HTML the angled brackets are used for tags < p > something < / p >. To display < and > we can use & l t; and & g t; It and gt stand for “less-than” and “greater-than”. This is called “HTML Character Reference”. Many other tags like & amp ; ---> & & quot ; ---> “
- Unicode: Assigns a number to more characters. The numbers are called “Codepoints”. ASCII codes ---> Unicode Codepoints 
- Representing Codepoints in Binary: Representing those numbers in binary isn’t as straightforward, there are multiple ways (with weird names) UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 

## Week 4- Manipulating Text and Text Editors
- Keyboard and mouse are the main ways of controlling the computer. With the keyboard we see way too many people struggling with slow, frustrating and unhealthy habits. Repetitive strain injury can be debilitating.
- Strengthening your back muscles may significantly reduce the risk of back pain. Perform exercises like the plank, hyperextension and deadlifts.
- Keyboards come in many styles and sizes: standard 104 key layout
- Physical, visual and functional layouts: Physical- arrangement and shape of keys Visual- labeling of keys Functional- software response to a key press 
- QWERTY and Country Specific Layouts: Layouts usually named after the top left row. QWERTZ is common in Germany, Eastern Europe and Portugal.
- A modifier key modifies the normal action of another key: Shift Control Alternate- also called Option on Apple keyboards Cmd- Command key on Apple keyboards Win- Windows logo on Windows keyboards Fn (Function)- use on small-layout keyboards, or keyboard where the top row of keys F1-F12 have multimedia functions like controlling audio volume
- Shortcuts: Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z
- Inside the keyboard: “Rubber dome” and “mechanical” switches are the most common. Many other types exist, including magnetic and optical. Keycap- Typically integrated mount (slider is part of the keycap itself). Upper Case- Typically contains slider guide shafts as part of the molding. Rubber Domes- Typically formed from a single rubber sheet, in the region of a 0.6mm thick. Top Membrane Layer- Traces and contact pads on lower surface. Centre Membrane Layer- The top layer is pressed against the bottom layer through the holes in the center layer. Bottom Membrane Layer- Traces and contact pads on upper surface. Lower Case- Supports the membrane assembly.
- Linear Keyboard: No bump, no click 
- Tactile Keyboard: Tactile bump, no click
- Clicky Keyboard: Tactile bump, audible click   
- Keyboard Safety: No keyboard is “best”, choose one you like. Avoid keyboards that frustrate you... oddly or inconsistently behaving keys, annoying sounds etc. If something feels odd: Change your posture, raise or lower your chair. Change the location and angle of the keyboard- try moving it away from yourself. Take a break! 
- Programmable Keyboards and Small Layouts: Example of a 60% keyboard. It lacks the F1-F12, arrow keys and many more Fn + something is used instead. For example: Fn + 1 = F1 
- Touch Typing: Typing without looking at the keyboard using all fingers. In 1888, Frank McGurrin won a decisive victory in a typing contest held in Cincinnati. The results were displayed on the front pages of many newspapers. McGurrin won $500 (about $16k today) and popularized the new typing method.
- Word Processors (MS Word) vs Text Editors (Notepad) 
- IDE= Integrated Development Environment. An IDE includes an editor + many other tools integrated into it. IDEs are often language specific: Webstorm for HTML, CSS, JavaScript PyCharm for Python Android Studio for Android apps 
- Text Mode Editors Are Still ALive and Popular: Vi vs Emacs- a source of flamewars since 1976. Appeared long before the mouse and had to rely on keyboard only. Vim is preinstalled on many Linux and MacOS by default.
- Exit Vim using ESC:q!
- Visual Studio Code: Microsoft VSCode IS NOT Visual Studio. First released in 2015- one of the younger editors and by far the most popular editor/IDE lately. Lots of extensions made by others, available online in multiplayer collaboration mode.
- Basic Search: Use Ctrl + F to find text 
- Wildcards: Use * for any character sequence
- /(reg)ex/: A tool for searching in text. A whole language for creating search patterns. The basics: .  Matches any character, [ abc ] matches any of the listed characters, [ a-z ] matches any lower-case letter, [ 0-9 ] matches any digit, do does /d 
- GitHub Pages: Purpose- Host web pages directly from GitHub repositories. Setup- Modify repository settings to enable GitHub Pages. Themes- Customize appearance using themes in _config.yml

## Week 5- Command Line Interfaces
- Batch Mode: Program writer prepared the program and input data on punch cards or tape. Operator ran it all. Results came back as paper printouts.
- "Interactive Terminals"- the original command line: Type a command. Press Enter. Computer prints out response on paper.
- Video Terminals: Thanks to mass production of consumer TVs, printers were replaced by monitors. But the same interaction continued, type a line, press enter, see the result printed on screen. Initially, the computer wasn’t even aware if its sending text to a paper, printer, or a monitor.
- Why Use CLI Today?: Some functionality has no GUI. Precise control. Easy automation of repetitive tasks (scripting). Faster- for some types of work. Works great remotely over slow networks. Requires very little computer resources compared to GUI.
- Starting the Terminal: MacOS- Spotlight: Terminal. Windows- Win key- Terminal. Or WSL- Windows Subsystem for Linux- a Linux VM running alongisde Windows To use WSL Install Ubuntu WSL via MS App Store 
- Starting the Terminal on Windows: Terminal, CMD, PowerShell
- Some Useful Commands: ls- list files in current directory pwd- print working directory cd- change directory cat, less- show contents of a text file cp, mv, mkdir- copy and move files, create a directory ping- ping a server over the network 
- grep – regex superpowers in CLI: Search text using patterns. Redirection and piping: Direct output to files or other commands. 
- Working Remotely SSH: Command line is great for working remotely- only short pieces of text are sent over the network. Ssh my.server.com The commands you type are addressed to that computer. SSH stands for “secure shell” because its encrypted in contrast to the older options like “telnet” that is rarely used now.   
- Sending Files Over the Network scp and sftp: cp copies a file locally cp myfile.txt some/other/dir/. scp can copy between computers scp myfile.txt myserver.com:some/remote/dir/. sftp is an ssh based version of much older ftp protocol that is used to copy files. Try to avoid ftp- its unencrypted. Ftp and sftp can be used via GUI clients like FileZilla.
- htop: Monitor system processes and resource usage. tmux: Terminal multiplexer for managing multiple sessions.
